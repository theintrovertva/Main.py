    >> Project Title: 
Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python.

   >> Project Description: 
This project was created as part of assessment task for thed ongoing Full Stack Zuri Training/Internship program I'm privileged to participate in. Even though this wasn't as easy as I would haved loved it to be, I'm sure as I keep learning Python and other programming languages and have a better understanding, I believe I will get better.
